# Random Composer

Constructs random music using audio samples.

## What is this?

This is a tool for creating random music from a collection of samples. The
tool original began as a way of constructing music using an [AKAI MPKmini](https://makebeats101.com/akai-mpk-mini-mk2-review/)
keyboard. It then morphed into being a tool for creating random music using
effects and self-recorded samples.
